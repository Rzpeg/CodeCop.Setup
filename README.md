# CodeCop.Setup
Fluent API for [CodeCop][2]

What?
====

A Fluent API wrapper package for [CodeCop][2], enabling a clean way of configuring interceptors via code.

Why ?
====

The default [CodeCop][2] "Fluent API" is not intuitive, sometimes confusing and really, not that <i>fluent</i>.
So I decided to fix it by building a completely new API. 

I also want to add some features missing from the [CodeCop][2], such as (but not limited to) loading hooks from various locations, including databases, files, and assemblies, integrating with your favourite IoC container and the likes. 

How ?
====

Everything resolves arround the configration API.
  
    Setup
        .Build()
        .InterceptMethodIn<Program>(nameof(DoStuff), Intercept.Before,
            ctx =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine("InterceptOn.Before > DoStuff !");
                return null;
            })
        .InterceptMethodIn<Program>(nameof(DoAnotherStuff), new MyInterceptor())
        .Create()
        .Activate();

The sample application CodeCop.Setup.Demo comes with the solution.
